            <h2>Duke of Edinburgh</h2>
            <p>I successfully completed a bronze Duke of Edinburgh award. I fulfilled the criteria by volunteering for 3 months at a high school science club. I also did running for 6 months through winter, as well as reciveing a first aid certification that took 3 months to complete.</p>

            <h2>Summer School</h2>
            <p>During summer 2017 I took part in LEAPs summer school, I completed courses in engineering and physics, maths and academic skills earning praise from lecturers in each.</p>

            <h2>Battleships</h2>
            <p>For my advanced higher computing science project, I created battleships on Java using netbeans for GUI aid. The program works very well, without any known bugs or exceptions possible to the user.</p>
