			<b>The idea that the universe can be understood</b> is a very powerful thought. This simple thought has given rise to the technological marvels of our age. I take great enjoyment from this discovery of the unknown and its practical use in the technology that has enriched the lives of everyone it has affected. Physics has always fascinated me due to its innate technological offshoots from, heating and lasers to microprocessors and efficient lighting. I was introduced to the wonders of physics at a relatively young age of 9 when I read Michio Kaku's physics of the impossible which described how the amazing tech from sci-fi like interplanetary ships capable sailing with no more than the light of the sun or robotics so advanced they could outdo even our great achievements, are all possible technologies! After that, I have sought out books such as Stephen Hawkings A Brief History of Time and Richard Feynman's Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman. These have led me to seek out knowledge in all the sciences but I have always been attracted to the understanding that physics provides.
			I greatly enjoyed a recent trip to Heriot Watt University for my Advanced Higher Physics project centered around angular momentum and torque. This experience gave me a better understanding of what the life of a physicist is like as I went through the process of writing up the experimental results as well as analysing, which I found greatly enjoyable as I had several text files that had to be parsed into excel which I used my programming knowledge to automate.

			<b>I am currently working</b> towards a bronze Duke of Edinburgh award. We just completed our first walk around the Pentlands, which I enjoyed profusely. We successfully navigated our route, even when a member had trouble keeping the pace I made sure we walked slower to keep together. I am also learning first aid as well as volunteering at science club where I have a significant job of ensuring our custom built hovercraft is working and maintained as well as making upgrades such as better insulation decreasing friction, leading to smoother ride.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>I have been involved</b> in many electronics projects, most notably a basic stepper motor powered walking robot controlled by Raspberry Pi, these projects have given me a greater understanding of electronics, programming and working with the Linux OS. I have had access to a 3D printer which has given me a lot of knowledge in practical engineering by designing parts for the previously mentioned robot including the legs and chassis.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>I have travelled</b> to many countries around the world such as Thailand, Egypt, and Mexico, I loved visiting foreign cultures and discovering their different approaches to life. On my visit to China, I enjoyed seeing all the fascinating artifacts from their past such as the massive Great Wall of China that stretched as far as I could see, as well as the Terracotta warriors, each with differing facial features from an army that stood thousands of years ago. During my trip to Florida, I had the most fun at Kennedy Space Centre where I enjoyed talks from the astronauts and their experience, as well as marvelling at the amazing engineering of the rockets.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>In my spare time</b> along with tinkering with computers and electronics, I enjoy playing chess against people who use many different strategies and are better at different time scales be it a 5 minute game to an hour. I have a particular liking of classical music with my favourites being Hanz Zimmer and John Williams. My favourite PC game is by far Kerbal Space Program, which NASA has worked with, which single-handedly taught me orbital mechanics such as ascent trajectory, circularization, orbital rendezvous and Hohmann transfers, the same manoeuvres used by the Apollo 11 team to land on the moon.
